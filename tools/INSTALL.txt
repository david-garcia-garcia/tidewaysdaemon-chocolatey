# Installation Windows

1. Run tideways-daemon.exe as background job with --address="127.0.0.1:8136"
2. Copy php_tideways_*.dll for your architecture (x86 or x64, nts or zts) to
   your PHP installations extension directory and rename to php_tideways.dll.

   You can find the extension directory by calling the following command:

        php -r 'echo ini_get("extension_dir");'

3. Copy Tideways.php into the same folder (extension directory) as php_tideways.dll
4. Change php.ini to load and configure the extension.

        extension=php_tideways.dll
        tideways.connection=tcp://127.0.0.1:8136

   Tideways is a regular extension, not a zend_extension.

Follow the PHP/Linux Setup instructions for your application on
https://tideways.io to configure the API Key, Sample-Rate and Framework.
